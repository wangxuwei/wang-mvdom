mvdom-patterns is a set of mini applications put together to illustrate some simple but scalable DOM and Javascript/Typescript Centric patterns to build small to advanced Web applications. YES, simple scale better!


## Concept

- Simple scale better. 
- Patterns outlast frameworks.
- Embrace the DOM, don't fight it. 
- Mega frameworks hardcode patterns, micro frameworks enable them. 
- Frameworks comes and go, runtimes last.
- Typescript does make Javascript scale.

Used right, the DOM does not need much to become a strong foundation for scalable application model. Here are some of those patterns using the mvDom DOM Centric micro-framework (< 12kb).
